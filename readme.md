# CodeLab I (CCO4000-20): Utility App - Assignment 2

## The Task

Your task is to create a Vending Machine program using the C++ programming language.

The Vending Machine must have the following features as a minimum requirement:

* A menu of drinks and snacks presented via the console. The number and range of items is up to you.
* A set of codes that the user can input to select a particular drink or snack.
* A way of capturing the user’s inputted code.
* A way of managing money. The user should be able to input any amount of money and have the correct change returned.
* A message that tells the user that a particular drink or snack has been dispensed.
* A message that tells the user how much change they have received.
* Comments in the code to explain key operations.

You may wish to add additional features to your Vending Machine to achieve higher marks. Below is an indication of some of these features, however you may wish to come up with your own:

* A method of categorising items in the vending machine to improve the user experience (e.g. ‘Chocolate’ or ‘Hot Drinks’).
* A way of allowing users to buy additional items if they have enough credit.
* An intelligence system for suggesting purchases. For example, if you buy a coffee, the vending machine may suggest that you buy biscuits.
* The use of functions to improve the structure of your program.
* A Graphical User Interface (GUI) that replaces console messages.


## Instructions

* First clone this repository to your machine using Github Desktop
* Create a new project for your Utility App in the repository folder
* Make regular commits and pushes while developing your code
* Make one final commit and push when you are happy with your solution

For a more detailed guide on cloning the repository and setting up your Utility App project refer to the guides folder. Video guides are also available on Aura.

## Deliverables

The deliverables for the Utility App are as follows:

### The Application

The C++ code (e.g. main.cpp file) and any supplementary assets required to run your vending machine. This should be submitted to your Github repository.

### The Development Document

Your Vending Machine C++ program must be accompanied by a Development Document of a minimum of 1000 words (there is no maximum word count). This development document should consist of the following elements: Brief, Specification, System Flowchart, Technical Description, Critical Reflection, Appendix (see brief for full details)

The development document should be submitted via Turnitin on Minerva. The development document should include a link to your Github repository and your GitHub username.

Incorrect submission will result in marks being deducted.
